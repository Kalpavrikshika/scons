# SCons
Hacking with SCons 

## What's SCons?

> SCons is an Open Source software construction toolâ€”that is, a next-generation build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.

## Setting up SCons

### Building from source - Ubuntu.

At the time of this writing the latest version of SCons is 3.0.1

Ensure Python is installed locally

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/src   
cd /opt/src/
sudo wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-3.0.1.tar.gz 
sudo tar -xvzf scons-3.0.1.tar.gz
cd scons-3.0.1/
sudo python setup.py install
```
